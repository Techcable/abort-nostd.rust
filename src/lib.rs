/// Abort the process, as if calling [`std::process::abort`]
/// or the C standard library [`abort`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/program/abort) function.
///
/// This immediately terminates the process,
/// without calling any destructors or exit codes.
///
///
/// ## Implementations
/// The preferred implementations delegate to a platform-specific abort function.
/// This is enabled whenever `feature = "std"` or `feature = "libc"` is enabled.
/// Using a preferred implementation is equivalent to calling [`immediate_abort`].
///
/// When a platform-specific abort function is not available,
/// this will fall back to using a `panic!` as described in the below section.
///
/// ## Safety
/// This function is **guaranteed** to terminate the process.
/// Unlike the `panic!` function,
/// this function will never unwind into caller code.
///
/// After aborting, this process will never execute any further user code.
/// It is possible some `panic!` code will run inside this function.
/// See the section below for more details.
///
/// ### Invoking `panic!` as fallback
/// No user code will run after invoking this function.
/// However, one of the fallback implementations uses [`core::panic!`] internally.
/// This will trigger the panic hook and run code from the standard library.
/// Outside a call to an `abort` function,
/// this is guaranteed to be the only other code invoked.
/// It will always be passed a `&'static str` argument,
/// which reduces or eliminates use of `core::fmt` machinery.
///
/// For safe code this shouldn't be much of an issue
/// unless you are bothered by the panic hook printing to standard error.
/// To avoid printing to standard output,
/// the easiest workaround is to enable an alternate implementation (see below).
///
/// For unsafe code, there may be further problems.
/// If `unsafe` invariants have been violated,
/// it may be unsafe to execute any code whatever
/// and the abort must be immediate.
///
/// If this usage is unacceptable, invoke the [`immediate_abort`] function instead.
/// This function will never use the fallback implementation.
/// If the primary implementation is missing,
/// it will simply be missing from the library (removed with `cfg`).
/// Alternatively, using the stdlib "panic_immediate_abort" feature should have a similar effect
/// and using the fallback implementation will be fine.
/// As a third choice, `feature = "always-immediate-abort"` will trigger a global compilation error
/// rather than use the fallback implementation.
